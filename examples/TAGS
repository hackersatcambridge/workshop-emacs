this first book proposes, first in brief, the whole subject, mans disobedience, and the loss thereupon of paradise wherein he was plac't: then touches the prime cause of his fall, the serpent, or rather satan in the serpent; who revolting from god, and drawing to his side many legions of angels, was by the command of god driven out of heaven with all his crew into the great deep. which action past over, the poem hasts into the midst of things, presenting satan with his angels now fallen into hell, describ'd here, not in the center (for heaven and earth may be suppos'd as yet not made, certainly not yet accurst) but in a place of utter darkness, fitliest call'd chaos: here satan with his angels lying on the burning lake, thunder-struck and astonisht, after a certain space recovers, as from confusion, calls up him who next in order and dignity lay by him; they confer of thir miserable fall. satan awakens all his legions, who lay till then in the same manner confounded;12,579
